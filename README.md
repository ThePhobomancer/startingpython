# Learning Python

This is my readme file. It is for documenting my programming knowledge.

## April 3rd

Beege and I installed several things and configured them.
First we installed a version manager (not a version control system) called asdf
Then we installed vim and python
This required a number of developer libraries for support of python
We created a project directory and a sub directory with mkdir
Then made main.py file using touch
We checked permissions with ll (alias of ls -l)
Then we changed permissions to allow (+) the user(u) to execute(x) (chmod u+x)
Entering the file with vim ./main.py
creating a shebang command (#!) then listing the directory path (/usr/bin/env) and file to use as the executable (python). This allows the system to search for the python executable whereever it is.
Wrote hello world (print("hello world")
exited with :wq (w for write to file, q for quit)

## April 10th
When opening a terminal in the gui the .profile is not read. .bashrc is read instead.
In visual studio, a white dot means there are unsaved portions of the file
